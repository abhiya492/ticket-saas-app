5. **Deploy to Netlify** ☁️

   This guide explains how to deploy your application to **Netlify** using the Netlify CLI with a single command.

   ### 📋 Prerequisites

   ✔️ **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.  
   ✔️ A **Netlify account**.

   ### 🚀 Steps to Deploy

   **1️⃣ Install the Netlify CLI ⚙️**

   If you haven’t already installed the Netlify CLI, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

   **2️⃣ Login to Netlify 🔑**

   Log in to your Netlify account by running:

   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

   🌐 This will open a browser window to authenticate your account.

   **3️⃣ Deploy Your Application 📂**

   Navigate to your project folder and run:

   ```bash
   netlify deploy
   ```

   **4️⃣ Select Deployment Options 🛠️**

   - If it’s your first deployment, the CLI will prompt you to:
     - 🌟 Create a **new site**, or
     - 🔗 Link to an **existing site**.
   - Specify the **build directory** (e.g., `dist`, `build`, or `public`, depending on your framework).

   **5️⃣ Deploy to Production (Optional) 🌐**

   To deploy directly to production, use the following command:

   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

   🎯 This will make your site live on your production URL.

   ### 📝 Notes

   💡 Ensure your project’s build output directory is correctly configured in your framework (e.g., React, Next.js, or Vue.js).  
   💡 Use the `--prod` flag only for production-ready deployments.

   🎉 **Congratulations!** Your site is now live on Netlify, and you’ll receive a URL to access it. 🌍✨
